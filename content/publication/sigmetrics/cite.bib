They help drones to navigate, identify suspicious activities from safety cameras, and perform diagnostics over medical imaging. Fast DNN inferencing close to the data source is enabled by a growing class of accelerated edge devices such as NVIDIA Jetson and Google Coral which host low-power Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) along with ARM CPUs in a compact form-factor to offer a superior performance-to-energy ratio. E.g., the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier kit has a 512-core Volta GPU, an 8-core ARM CPU and 32GB LPDDR4x memory, that operates within 65W of power, costs US999 and is smaller than a paperback novel.Recently, there has been a push towards training DNN models on the edge [2]. This is driven by the massive growth in data collected from edge devices in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT), the need to refresh the models periodically, the bandwidth constraints in moving all this data to Cloud data centers for training, and a heightened emphasis on privacy by retaining data on the edge. This has led to techniques like federated and geo-distributed learning that train DNN models locally on data on an edge device and aggregate them centrally. In this abstract, we summarise and highlight key results from our full paper [5].}, booktitle = {Abstract Proceedings of the 2023 ACM SIGMETRICS International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems}, pages = {37â€“38}, numpages = {2}, keywords = {dnn training, edge accelerators, performance characterization}, location = {Orlando, Florida, United States}, series = {SIGMETRICS '23} }
