title: "Credit Card Fraud Detection"
summary: "We based our work on the dataset provided in Kaggle [1] under Open Database license. This dataset is already normalized but is highly biased towards Non-Fraud transactions, as is expected of a legal nature of transactions across the world. Feeding this raw data to our algorithm will highly affect its results. So, data pre-processing is a must to ensure correctness and validity of results. For addressing this issue, we have implemented the bagging phase. Since we are concerned with classification of feature vectors, we implemented SVM with Gaussian and Polynomial kernel functions. Also, we have explored two different strategies for training our classsifer."
