title: "Leveraging static analysis for evaluating code-generation models"
summary: "In recent times, the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has gained substantial traction. Despite their promising prospects, code produced by these tools often suffers from bugs, hampering their overall utility. Our study aims to enrich the baseline code generation model by incorporating insights from static error analysis, potentially refining code generation quality. To achieve this objective, we introduce a pipeline that assimilates feedback gleaned from static analysis into the baseline model. Furthermore, we enhance the baseline model by fine-tuning it using samples previously rejected due to static errors. Our empirical observations underscore the efficacy of both strategies in mitigating the occurrence of observed static errors.<br>This work was done for the course project of CSCI 544 Applied Natural Language Processing, Fall 2023, USC."
