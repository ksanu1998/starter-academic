title: "A multimodal architecture with shared encoder that uses spectrograms for audio"
summary: "Multimodal learning aims to create models that pro- cess and relate information from multiple modalities. A shared encoder architecture may be capable of fusing multimodal information while providing better synergy between modalities compared to architectures that use separate encoders. We work on a novel audio-visual learning paradigm where audio data is represented as spectrograms, in order for the embeddings to be used with an encoder that is shared between audio and video data. <br>This work is being done for the course project of CSCI 535 Multimodal Probabilistic Learning of Human Communication, Spring 2024, USC."
