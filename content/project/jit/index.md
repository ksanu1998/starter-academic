title: "Runtime Optimization in Java Virtual Machines"
summary: "In this report we discuss about runtime optimizations in Java Virtual Machines. We first present some basic framework about Java, virtual machines, JVM and code optimization. Next, we explain the philosophy behind Java and understand how Java works, by going through the concepts of bytecode, role of JVM and JIT compiler. Finally, we delve into the runtime optimizations part, where we explain about hotspots, inlining, local, global and control flow optimizations."
