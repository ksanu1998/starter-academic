I am a first year CS Master's student at the University of Southern California. My research interests are chiefly Federated Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Edge-Computing,  Edge-Accelerator Performance Characterization, Distributed and Stochastic Optimization.

Previously, I was Project Associate - I at DREAM:Lab, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a> Bangalore, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>, where I worked on performance characterization of Nvidia Jetson edge-accelerators on deep learning workloads, and also on a Federated Learning project.

Prior to that, I graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in">IIT Dharwad</a>, where I worked on Federated Algorithms with Bayesian and Exponential Weighted Average approaches for my BTech Project, as a member of LIaN research group, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com">B. N. Bharath</a>.
