I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, during which I was a Research Assistant and Course Producer for graduate-level ML courses, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>. I worked as a Machine Learning Software Intern at <a href="https://www.degirum.ai/">DeGirum Corp.</a> Earlier I worked on systems for ML research at <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science</a> as a Project Associate, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>. Prior to that I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad</a>, where I worked on FL, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com/">B N Bharath</a>. I am a recipient of several accolades such as J N Tata Endowment Scholarship, NSF Travel Grant, Gift Award and Travel Grant by Tata Education and Development Trust.<br><br>

<!-- rI am a second year master’s student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>. I have been awarded the prestigious <a href="https://www.tata.com/newsroom/backing-the-brightest-jn-tata-endowment-fund">J N Tata Endowment scholarship</a> for the higher education of Indians.

I currently work as a Course Producer for CSCI 567: Machine Learning, offered by the Department of Computer Science at USC in Spring 2024, and for CSCI 699: Theory of Machine Learning, a doctoral-level course offered in Fall 2023, taught by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>. During Summer 2023, I worked as a Machine Learning Software Intern at <a href="https://www.degirum.ai">DeGirum Corp.</a>, Santa Clara, where I developed an ONNX OCR pipeline with pre and post-processor modules compatible with edge-hardware, and worked on a NumPy-only implementation of the forward pass of some vision-based PyTorch operators. During Spring and Summer 2023, I was a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at USC, advised by Prof. Vatsal Sharan, where I contributed to an open source project on tensor decomposition methods, and worked on a faster C++ implementation of a random forest based anomaly-detection algorithm.

Previously, I was Project Associate - I at DREAM:Lab, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>, where I worked on performance characterization of Nvidia Jetson edge-accelerators on deep learning workloads, a review of systems research into training deep learning models on the edge hardware, and also on a Federated Learning project.

Prior to that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Dharwad</a>. I worked on Federated Algorithms with Bayesian and Exponential Weighted Average approaches for my B.Tech. Project, as a member of LIaN research group, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com/">B. N. Bharath</a>.-->
