I am a second year master's student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My research interests are chiefly Statistical Machine Learning, Edge-GPU Performance Characterization, Deep Learning Theory, Stochastic Optimization, Federated Learning, and Embedded Computing.

<!-- Currently, I work on-campus as a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at USC Viterbi, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>, where I focus on code optimization for open source projects on tensor decomposition methods, and anomaly detection using density-based algorithms.  -->

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Software Intern at <a href="https://www.degirum.ai/">DeGirum Corp.</a>, Santa Clara, where I work on model optimization for hardware. I am also a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at USC Viterbi, advised by Prof. <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/">Vatsal Sharan</a>, where I am contributing to an open source project on tensor decomposition methods, and working on a faster C++ implementation of a random forest based anomaly-detection algorithm.

Previously, I was Project Associate - I at DREAM:Lab, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc</a> Bangalore, advised by Prof. <a href="http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Yogesh Simmhan</a>, where I worked on performance characterization of Nvidia Jetson edge-accelerators on deep learning workloads, and also on a Federated Learning project.

Prior to that, I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitdh.ac.in">IIT Dharwad</a>. I worked on Federated Algorithms with Bayesian and Exponential Weighted Average approaches for my B.Tech. Project, as a member of LIaN research group, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bnbharath.wordpress.com">B. N. Bharath</a>.
